## **The Elevator Pitch**
I’m Greg. I’m a gay, blind, middle-aged guy living in Burien, Washington. If you found this page looking for a corporate bio or some "thought leadership," you’ve definitely taken a wrong turn at the search bar. This is my digital living room—shoes off, please.

## **The Geekery**
I’m an unapologetic tech tinkerer. I straddle the line between Apple fanboy and Linux power user, mostly because I enjoy things that work *and* things I can break. Being blind, I experience the web differently than most. I built this site to be strictly accessible (WCAG 2.2 AA) not just because it’s the right thing to do, but because I know exactly how frustrating it is when the internet decides to be an obstacle course.

## **The Vibe**
Culturally, I’m pretty much permanently parked in a timeline that stretches from the 1970s straight through the late 2000s. I do occasionally dip a toe into modern media if it’s genuinely good, but I’m mostly here for the golden era. My movie night is a chaotic mix of action, comedy, and sci-fi—think *Die Hard*, *Ghostbusters*, or *The Matrix* playing on repeat. If it has practical effects or a plot hole big enough to drive a DeLorean through, I’m watching it.

My playlist is even less disciplined. It’s a constant battleground where Mötley Crüe and Def Leppard fight for dominance against Dr. Dre, Madonna, and Daft Punk. I also devour audiobooks and podcasts at a rate that probably concerns my service provider, mostly so I can pretend I’m multitasking while I mess with my latest project.

## **Fuel & Chill**
While my soul belongs to the holy trinity of burgers, tacos, and pizza, my appetite wanders the globe. I’m just as happy diving into a spicy Indian curry, Mediterranean hummus, or a bowl of pho as I am wrecking a plate of nachos. That said, I will politely (or impolitely) decline blue cheese and Brussels sprouts. Life is too short for moldy cheese and tiny, bitter cabbages.

To unwind, I enjoy good drinks, laughter with friends, and a little cannabis to keep those Pacific Northwest chill vibes authentic.

## **Wander Around**
Feel free to poke around. You can read my [Articles](/articles/) if you have some time to kill, check the [Status Updates](/status/) for my random brain noise, or sign the [Guestbook](/guestbook/) so I know I'm not just shouting into the void.
