## **The Philosophy**
Let’s be real: I’m blind. I use a screen reader every single day. I know exactly how frustrating it is when a website is nothing but a soup of unlabelled buttons and low-contrast text.

When I built **Greg's Place**, accessibility wasn't an afterthought or a compliance checklist—it was the foundation. My goal is simple: this site should work perfectly for everyone, regardless of how you browse the web. Whether you’re using NVDA, VoiceOver, a braille display, or just really cranked-up text magnification, you are welcome here.

## **The Standards**
I target **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** compliance. To achieve this, I’ve made some specific design choices:
* **Semantic HTML:** Everything is built with proper heading structures (`h1`–`h6`) and landmarks so you can navigate by rotor or shortcut keys without getting a headache.
* **High Contrast:** I use an "Outlined Card" design system that relies on distinct borders rather than subtle shadows.
* **Privacy Facades:** Video embeds (like YouTube) are static images until you click them. This prevents keyboard traps and keeps third-party tracking scripts off your back.
* **No "Mouse-Only" Nonsense:** If you can click it, you can tab to it.

## **The Reality Check**
This is a personal site, not a corporate enterprise. I am the design team, the dev team, and the QA department. While I test everything thoroughly with my own tools, bugs happen. Updates break things. Sometimes I just mess up.

## **Feedback**
If you hit a barrier, please tell me. I don’t want to just "log the ticket"—I want to fix it.
* **Contact Me:** Drop me a line via the [Contact Page](/contact/).
* **The Details:** If you can, tell me what browser or assistive tech you were using when things went sideways.

Let’s keep the web open.
