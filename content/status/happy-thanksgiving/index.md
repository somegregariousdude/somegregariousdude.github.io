    alt = """A high-angle medium shot captures a bountiful, home-cooked Thanksgiving spread crowding a table. The feast centers on large aluminum trays holding a roasted turkey with golden-brown skin and a glazed ham. Surrounding the main courses are bowls of comfort food staples: bright yellow macaroni and cheese, rich brown baked beans, a fresh cucumber salad, and a large bowl of gravy.

The background reveals an eclectic mix of decor and personal items. Behind the food, a wooden lantern covered in "I Voted" stickers sits alongside a Santa Claus plate and a set of Three Wise Men figurines. On the wall, a calendar marks November 2025, while a rectangular mirror reflects the photographer with long dark hair capturing the holiday moment."""

Happy Thanksgiving... It's the start of the holidays and I'm enjoying some time with my best friend at his place. Just the two of us, but man does he go all out for holiday meals! I bet it makes you hungry just looking at this photo. Now that I've shared, time to sip on some eggnog.
